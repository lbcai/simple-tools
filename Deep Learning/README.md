# Deep Learning
This is a series of Jupyter Notebook files written while reading [Andrew W. Trask's](https://github.com/iamtrask/) book <i>Grokking Deep Learning</i>. 
Code exercises and notes on the actual reading are both present. The purpose of these exercises is to become more familiar with the fundamental workings and capabilities of
basic machine learning techniques.

The current goal is to finish the reading and independently produce a machine learning project. This README will be updated with a summary at a later date.
